    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>We are the Three Monks of Mass. With a passion for Gregorian Chant music,
    we are in production for our 29th album, "One Hot Mass". Consisting of three soprano
  monks, this band is working to change the face of Gregorian Music in monestaries around the world.

    <h3>Meet the members</h3>
    <p>Father Kari resides from deep in the forests of rural Illinois. Growing up in
    a hut, she found her passion for singing when she was asked to call her many dogs
    back to the house for supper. She joined the monks after her family left her
    at the gas station at the age of 3. Since then, she has taken the role as back-up
    to the back-up lead soprano singer, and plans on staying in that position until she dies.
